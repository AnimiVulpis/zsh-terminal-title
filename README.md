# zsh-terminal-title

Terminal title setting plugin for zsh with no options

## Attribution

The plugin is based on a zsh script posted by
[romkatv](https://github.com/romkatv) in a comment
[here](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/issues/1092#issuecomment-723039693)
which was put under the same license as [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/LICENSE).
See the [copy of the original license](powerlevel10k-LICENSE.md) or the [current license](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/LICENSE).

## General information

I try to adhere to the best practices pointed out [here](https://zdharma.org/zinit/wiki/zsh-plugin-standard/)

## Possible future work

- Support configuration options
- Adhere to [function name prefixes](https://zdharma.org/zinit/wiki/zsh-plugin-standard/#the_proposed_function-name_prefixes) proposed by [zdharma](https://github.com/zdharma/)
